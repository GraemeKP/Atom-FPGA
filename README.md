This is a Xilinx/AMD ISE project for a custom PCB that includes a Spartan6 FPGA, a video DAC and a few minor peripherals.
The intention is to include within the FPGA a 6502 CPU core and all necessary elements (VDG, PIA, ROM, RAM, etc) to emulate an Acorn Atom computer.
The VHDL is complete but the project needs various ipcores.
